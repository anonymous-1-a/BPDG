process text:
Students generate the form and convert it to a PDF. Meanwhile, students collect the required documents, such as transcripts of records, English test results, and their CV. After generating the form and collecting the required documents, students send all of them by post to the admissions office. The admissions office then checks to see if the documentation is complete. If the documentation is incomplete, the admissions office requests the missing documents from the students by email, and the process loops back to the students sending the documents until all documentation is complete.

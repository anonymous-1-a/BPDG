process text:
If the system is operational, it will first attempt to find a suitable room and time slot. If a proper fit is identified, the system will automatically make the selection. However, if the system cannot locate an appropriate option, it will revisit its availability at a later time. In the event that the system is not currently active, the selection process will need to be handled manually.

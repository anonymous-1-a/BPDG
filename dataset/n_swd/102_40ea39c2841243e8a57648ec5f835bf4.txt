On the 1st day of the month, the ISP initiates the process by sending an invoice to the customer. By the 7th day, the ISP debits the full amount from the customer's account. If the transaction fails, on the 8th day, the ISP notifies the customer and retries on the 9th day. If the issue persists, on the 10th day, the ISP takes necessary action. If a late fee is charged on the 14th day, the ISP proceeds accordingly. By the 30th day, if the internet service is suspended, the ISP closes the account and applies the disconnection fee simultaneously. Following this, the ISP initiates debt recovery. If the issue does not recur, the process is skipped. If the transaction is successful, the process is also skipped.

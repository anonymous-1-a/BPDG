The administrator of ACME Manufacturing starts the process. Following that, the administrator initiates an engineering change request in the PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) system, which takes approximately 30 minutes. If it is a minor change request, the draftsman is notified and makes changes (within 2 hours), initiates the approval process in PLM (within 1 hour), and PLM alerts engineers and the manager. Next, the manager reviews the change (within 30 minutes). If the change is approved, they notify the administrator of the approval. Otherwise, no changes are made. If it is a major change request, the engineer is notified to analyze the change and make recommendations (within 8 hours). Next, the approval process is initiated in PLM (within 1 hour). Then, the manager reviews the major change (within 1 hour). If the major change is approved, the manager notifies the draftsman of the approval and the draftsman updates the changes (within 8 hours). Otherwise, no changes are made. Finally, the administrator checks the changes into PLM (1.5 hours) and the change is completed.

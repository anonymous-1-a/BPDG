The emergency staff will start the normal flow by examining the patient and the information. If further details have been gathered, they will obtain additional information; otherwise, they will skip this step. Following this, the emergency staff will decide on further treatment, prescribing for simple conditions and directing individuals to immunization, investigations, surgery, or further consultation. Once these tasks are completed in parallel, they will then prescribe for complex conditions. Finally, the emergency staff will admit the patient to the ward.

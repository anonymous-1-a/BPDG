Perfect Pixels handles digital requests by sending a Dropbox link. For print-out requests, they drop off the prints at the counter. If it's a print-out and delivery request, Perfect Pixels sends the prints via postal delivery. Next, Perfect Pixels decides on issuing a voucher. If the customer is a private customer with an invoice amount exceeding $200, Perfect Pixels will send a voucher; otherwise, they will skip this action.

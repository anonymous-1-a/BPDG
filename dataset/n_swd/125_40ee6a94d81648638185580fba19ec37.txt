Customer service of the Customer Service Department confirms the obtained order. They then proceed to check the production location. If the location is incorrect, they will change it; if it is correct, they will move on to checking the delivery date. In case the delivery date is wrong, they will edit it; if it is correct, they will proceed. Next, they will check for any open orders. If there are only a few items, they will look for samples or a happy gateau. If no order is placed, they will contact the customer. If adjustments are required, they will make them. If the order is accurate, they will continue without changes. If the order is already placed, this step will be skipped.

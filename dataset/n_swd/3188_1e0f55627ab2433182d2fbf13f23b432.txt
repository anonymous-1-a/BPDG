To begin the grooming process, the intern should start by performing a quick shampoo. If the cleanliness level is not satisfactory, the intern should repeat the shampooing process. Once the cleanliness level meets the standard, the intern can proceed to exit the process. The master groomer of the grooming process will then evaluate the dog's condition. If the dog is agitated, the veterinarian in charge of the grooming process will sedate the dog. If the dog is calm, they will skip this step. Following this, the master groomer will proceed to cut the dog's hair. The master groomer should also clean the dog's ears, while the intern trims the dog's nails simultaneously. Finally, perform dental care and dog grooming.

The distribution manager of AskmeAnything starts by setting up a weekly stand-up meeting. They prioritize tasks with Post-Its and then place them on the Kanban Board. Employees of AskmeAnything voluntarily pick tasks. If all tasks have not been distributed, the distribution manager will randomly distribute them. If all tasks have been distributed, they will skip this step. Finally, the employees record the tasks in Trello.

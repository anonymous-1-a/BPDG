The warehouse worker at the hardware retailer packages goods. The clerk at the hardware retailer decides whether to use normal post or special shipment. If a special carrier is chosen, the clerk requests quotes from carriers, assigns a carrier, and prepares paperwork. For normal carrier delivery, the clerk checks if extra insurance is required. If so, the logistics manager arranges it. Once these tasks are completed in parallel, the warehouse worker of the hardware retailer adds paperwork and moves the package to the pick area.

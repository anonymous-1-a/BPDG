The sales representative of Products received an order and collected customer details. If repair or replacement is required, they recorded the details, checked stock, calculated the price, and collected payment. If not needed, they negotiated order details, prepared a drawing, and noted additional requirements if any. Finally, they received commission as a retailer.

The older clerk of Products confirmed the order arrival and checked payment status. If installation was needed, the installer contacted the warehouse, received requirements, and scheduled installation. Once completed, they set the status as completed. If no installation was necessary, they skipped the process. The Packer/Assembly team then packed orders, prioritizing urgent shipments. After packing and assembly, the products were ready for shipping.

The production team at Cherchel Branch gets raw materials from the warehouse, then weighs the raw materials. Following this, the team performs in-process control. They must choose one of the three production methods: Dry Granulation, Direct Compression, or Wet Granulation. After this exclusive choice, if the product is a tablet, the Cherchel Branch will start by producing tablets using the tablet press. They will then coat, inspect, and carry out the primary packaging of the tablets. If the product is in powder form, the production process at the Cherchel Branch will involve filling. Subsequently, the team will move on to secondary packaging before transporting the final product to the warehouse.

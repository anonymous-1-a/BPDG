The Sales Department of the Company receives a customer order and checks the inventory. If there are enough products, the Sales Department will create an order to the warehouse. If there are not enough products, a production order will be created, and the Purchasing Department will take over. The Purchasing Department will then create a purchase order, select a supplier, arrange transportation for the components, and make the necessary purchases. If there are enough components, this step will be skipped, and the Company will proceed with the production process. 

Simultaneously, the Warehouse of the Company will be collecting and packing the products. Once ready, the sales department will arrange transportation for the products and invoice the customer. Finally, the Warehouse of the Company will ship out the products.

The parent initiates Forsakringskassan. Then, the parent selects the child. After that, the parent enters the transfer days. The Forsakringskassan system checks for eligible days. If there are eligible days remaining, the system proceeds to assess transferable days and their levels. If a transfer is viable, the system manages credit and debit days accordingly. Upon completion, the system ceases operations. However, if a transfer is not possible, the system also stops.

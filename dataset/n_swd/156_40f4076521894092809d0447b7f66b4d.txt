Sales of order management receive order details. Next, they prepare the order for logistics. The logistics team then checks the product availability. If the availability is confirmed, the logistics team handles the order, reserves the product for the customer, and the sales team sends an invoice, prepares the delivery, and finalizes the order management process upon successful completion. If the availability is not confirmed, the order management team reorders any missing products and verifies the order amount. If the quantity exceeds 3000, the team prints and signs the order; otherwise, they skip this step. Following this, the team sends the order to the supplier and receives a preliminary date. Subsequently, the sales team sends a sales confirmation to the customer, tracks the order, and manages any delivery delays.

The SAP CERT of Security Patch Management Process (CIS, ByD, C4C, Payroll) receives notifications about high, medium, or low patches. Next, the Non-Scalable Unit of Security Patch Management Process (CIS, ByD, C4C, Payroll) checks if any of the patches are applicable. If applicable patches are found, they are classified as online or offline, and the need for downtime is determined. A ticket for Request for Change (RfC) is opened if necessary. The Change Advisory Board (CAB) reviews the RfC if the patch is not pre-approved; otherwise, this step is skipped. The process then moves on to preparing and testing security patches on sandbox systems for units like CIS, ByD, C4C, and Payroll. If issues arise during testing, further investigation is conducted; otherwise, the process is exited. Internally announce the change for non-online patches and update the system. Reboot servers if required. Finally, close the ticket for the Non-Scalable Unit of Security Patch Management Process (CIS, ByD, C4C, Payroll).

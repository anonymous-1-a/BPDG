In the process of reward and training, first, the management checks the employee performance.
If the performance is less than 20%, the management suggests the employee's dismissal to the human resources department (HR). Then, the HR dismisses the employee.

If the employee performance is greater than 20% but less than 50%, the management will suggest training, which in turn is provided by HR.

If the performance exceeds 75%, the management suggests the employee for reward.
There may be either a financial reward or another benefit. Regarding the latter, the management chooses an appropriate benefit. The financial reward is calculated and paid by the finance department. Finally, the management announces the rewarded employee as employee of the month.

If data is required, the process begins. UniPartners assesses the project specifications and then determines the appropriate collection methods.

If a questionnaire is required, the first step is to develop the questionnaire. Next, UniPartners assesses the questionnaire and determines the target group. The questionnaire is then distributed to the respondents. Finally, the completed questionnaires are obtained from the respondents.

If an interview is required, UniPartners first determines the interviewees and then proceeds to contact them. If an invitation is rejected, UniPartners continues to determine other potential interviewees. However, if an invitation is accepted, UniPartners develops an interview structure and conducts the interview.

If a client database is required, UniPartners requests access to the database. Once database access is granted, UniPartners assesses the client database and retrieves the relevant data.

After completing one of the three paths mentioned above, UniPartners compiles the collected data.

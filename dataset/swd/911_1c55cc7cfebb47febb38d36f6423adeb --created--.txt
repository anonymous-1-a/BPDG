When the Level 1 executives of the Synovus call center receive a request for a debit card replacement, the process begins. Firstly, the Level 1 executives perform an initial identity verification of the caller. Next, they proceed with preliminary data collection.
Afterward, two sub-processes are performed simultaneously.
The first step is to confirm whether the delivery needs to be made to an alternate address. If an alternate address is required, the process for the alternate address is initiated. If an alternate address is not required, no further action is taken. This subprocess then comes to an end.
The second step is more complex. The Level 1 executives assess whether the customer is eligible for a fee exemption. If the customer is eligible for a fee exemption, someone needs to review the fee exemption request. If a team lead is available, the team lead will review the fee exemption. If a team lead is not available, the supervisor will review the fee exemption. If neither a team lead nor a supervisor is available, the manager will review the fee exemption request. If the fee is exempted, the Level 1 executives will exempt the fee and enter this information into the system. However, if the fee is not exempted, the decision to not exempt the fee will be entered into the system. In both cases, this subprocess comes to an end.
After the two sub-processes have finished, the Level 2 executives will proceed with the identity verification of the caller. Next, they will verify the address and clear any account holds. Finally, they will place the order for the card replacement.

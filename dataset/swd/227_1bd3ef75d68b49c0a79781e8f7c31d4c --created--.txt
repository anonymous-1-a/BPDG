Gold Merchants Bank's loan process is as follows: The business lender receives a loan application from the customer, and the processing of the application begins. The SAP System performs a credit check on the application and, if approved, generates an application document. From this approved application document, a risk assessment profile is created. The SAP System then assesses the suitability of the loan and obtains a Commercial Lending Compliance Checklist. If the financial risk associated with the application is deemed unacceptable, the lender will reject the application and send a notification to the customer. In this case, the loan process comes to an end. If the financial risk associated with the application is deemed acceptable, the business lender will proceed with the next steps. They will send company and title searches to RCS Data Intelligence, while also arranging for customer reference reports to be sent to the same organization. Subsequently, the business lender will receive the customer credit report from RCS Data Intelligence. The Business Lender and Risk Assessment Center reviews the report to ensure satisfaction. If the customer credit reports are found to be unsatisfactory, the application is rejected, and a notification is sent to the customer. In the other case, the SAP system performs a final review of the customer file. If the application is rejected during this review, the SAP system sends a notification of application rejection to the customer. However, if the application is approved, the SAP system sends a loan offer to the customer. If the customer rejects the loan offer, the loan application will be rejected. On the other hand, if the customer accepts the loan offer, the Risk Assessment Center will proceed to prepare the necessary legal documents. Subsequently, the center will request the application fee from the customer. Once the application fee is received, the SAP system will compile the customer file and save it to the Customer Information Database. The documents will then be delivered to the loan center. After the documents have been successfully delivered, the loan process comes to an end.

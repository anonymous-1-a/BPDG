When applying for a loan at BBS (Banking and Business Services), the process involves several steps. First, the loan application is finalized by the applicant. Then, BBS reviews the complete submission, using a tracker from the data store. After the review, BBS adds advice to the customer's file, also using a tracker from the data store. The next step is for the commercial lender to make a decision regarding the loan application, using the tracker from the data store.
Once the commercial lender has made a decision, they advise the customer about the outcome. At this point, the commercial lender waits for a message from the customer. If the loan application is approved, the commercial lender receives an approval letter. Alternatively, if the loan application is rejected, the commercial lender receives a rejection letter. In both cases, the customer (represented as "U") is involved in sending the respective letter to the approver or rejection.
If the commercial lender does not receive any response from the customer, they wait for one month after receiving the customer's information. After the one-month period, if there is still no customer response, the loan application is considered rejected, and the process ends with the commercial lender rejecting the application.
If the loan application is approved, the commercial lender proceeds to collect a documentation fee. After collecting the fee, the commercial lender prepares the necessary legal documentation. Once the legal documentation is prepared, BBS completes the loan application. This leads to the creation of a customer profile with a credit rating (CR) data object. Finally, the loan offer is finalized by BBS, and the process concludes with the loan offer being finalized.

The Citigroup Inter-Corporation Business-to-Business (B2B) Network U-Turn Request workflow is as follows:
1. Requestors submit a NE Project Request for B2B U-Turn implementation.
2. The 3rd Party Access Solutions Workgroup (3PASWG) receives product order requests, analyzes requirements, and then assigns a network engineer.
3. 3PASWG notifies the requestor of B2B U-Turn implementation requirements and the CCR approval process. The requestor obtained business justification, a BISO statement of compliance, and a signed B2B U-Turn notification letter in the notification. At the same time, 3PASWG creates a high-level B2B U-Turn diagram for providing it to the requestor.
4. Requestors submit B2B U-Turn approval requests in CCR. The 3PASWG then reviews the request, and immediately thereafter, it refers the request to the Information Security Technology Group (ISTG) for review.
5. ISTG reviews the request and notifies the requester of rejection or approval, depending on its review. The process ends after rejection. If the review notifies the requestor of approval, the requestor receives an approval notification and notifies NE. After the requester is notified of the approval, the 3PASWG first proceeds with the design and implementation of the B2B U-Turn and then advises the requester to register the U-Turn in the CCR. The process ends when the requester registers a B2B U-Turn in CCR.

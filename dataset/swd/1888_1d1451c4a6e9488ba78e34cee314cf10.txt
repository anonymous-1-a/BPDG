When meteorologists report the daily weather conditions, they identify areas that require attention. These areas are then reported for further analysis. Geologists analyze the geological conditions in these areas to identify potential events. Once a potential event is identified, the geologists report it. Similarly, hydrologists analyze the hydrological conditions in the identified areas and report any potential events they find.
In addition, disaster analysts analyze the conditions of the affected communities and identify potential events. They report these potential events as well. The reported potential events are then analyzed by a team. The team includes members from different disciplines, such as geologists, hydrologists, and disaster analysts.
If there is no doubt regarding the potential event, the team opens a warning. However, if there are doubts, the team holds a meeting to discuss the situation further. After the meeting, whether doubts exist or not, the team determines the warning level. They also identify the team member responsible for reporting the warning.
The geologist describes the geological conditions at the affected area, while the hydrologist describes the hydrological conditions. Based on this information, the disaster analyst revises the warning file. If necessary, the hydrologist also provides input on the warning file. Once the warning file is revised, the disaster analyst registers the warning in the organizational systems.
Finally, the disaster analyst communicates the warning to relevant parties, marking the end of the process.

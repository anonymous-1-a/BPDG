If Gerai needs to initiate a return, the process begins as follows: Firstly, Gerai creates a return request. The return request is then reviewed by RRM (Regional Retail Manager), RCM (Regional Category Manager), and RSM (Regional Sales Manager) in that order. The Head of Retail (HOR) reviews the request second.
If any of these reviewers feel that the request needs to be edited or should be rejected, they inform Gerai to edit the request, and then a re-assessment is done. When both reviewers approve the request, it moves on to the retail operation for review. If the request is rejected, Gerai edits the request for the next round of review. If the return request is approved, Gerai prepares the item for return and submits a return note to TNM.
After that, Gerai receives a Good Issue note, and the process comes to an end after the item is returned.

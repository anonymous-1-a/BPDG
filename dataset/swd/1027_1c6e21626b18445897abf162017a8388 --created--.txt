The process begins with the inquiry officer of the police station receiving an incident case from citizens. They then proceed to gather information from the citizens and save it in the system. If there is a suspect related to the incident, the investigation officer of the police station will conduct an investigation. Once the investigation is complete, the inquiry officer will summarize and finalize the incident report based on the information stored in the system. If there is no suspect involved in the incident, the inquiry officer will directly summarize and finalize the incident report using the information in the system.

After the inquiry officer summarizes and finalizes the incident report, the Deputy Superintendent of the Police Station will check the incident report in the system. If there is not enough information available in the report, the Deputy Superintendent will gather additional information from the citizens once again. Once enough information is obtained, the superintendent of the police station will then proceed to check the incident report in the system.

If the superintendent thinks that there is not enough information in the incident report, they will return the report to the deputy superintendent for further checking. If a further investigation is deemed necessary, the superintendent will initiate the process of litigating a dispute in court before the process comes to an end. However, if no further investigation is required, the process will simply end.

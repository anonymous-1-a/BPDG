This is a company's purchasing process. In the first place, the purchasing agent creates a request for quotation, and a price comparison should happen afterward. Then, the purchasing agent creates a contract with the source chosen. After that, they should create a purchase requisition, assign the requisition to the source, and create a purchase order later. Next, the warehouse clerk processes inbound deliveries and posts goods receipts. After receiving the goods receipt, the account payable clerk invoices verification, and the account payable manager processes the blocked invoice. Finally, the account payable clerk will make payment to the vendor.

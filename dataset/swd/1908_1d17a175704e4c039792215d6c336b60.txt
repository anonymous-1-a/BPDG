The Administration of the Kitchen department is responsible for receiving clients and discussing their requirements with the Designer. Once the requirements are discussed, the Designer proceeds to create a design. The Administration then sends the design to the client. If the offer is declined, the process of creating and sending the design is repeated until an accepted offer is received.

Once an offer is accepted, the Builder checks the dimensions while the Finance department proceeds to purchase the necessary equipment. Simultaneously, the Administration plans the date for the project.

After the date is planned, the Builder begins by removing the old kitchen while cutting the shelves simultaneously. Following that, the Builder proceeds to assemble the new kitchen.

After the kitchen is assembled, the Finance department proceeds to send the invoice. If there is no response within one hour, Finance sends a reminder for the invoice until payment is received.

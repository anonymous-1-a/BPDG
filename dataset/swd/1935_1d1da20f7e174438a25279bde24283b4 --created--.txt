This process is about creating a single database (ADI-18114). The activity begins with two parallel processes:
	1. The management team defines the process for data maintenance (ADI-18137). Next, they implement the data maintenance process (ADI-18137).
	2. The operations team starts by cleaning the data from the CI databases (ADI-17160). At the same time, the QA team prepares the environments and their deployment (ADI-17922). Once the operations team has finished cleaning the data and the QA team has prepared the environments and their deployment, the QA team deploys the environment with clean CI databases. While both the operations team and the QA team are doing their tasks, the development teams analyze the data to be added (e.g., ADI-18314). Once the QA team has deployed the environment with clean CI databases and the development teams have analyzed the data to be added, the development teams insert the data into the database using the client (ADI-18114). Next, the QA team backs up the databases with the new data, creating a single database seed for core development. Then, the operations team updates the environments to use the new databases.

When the two parallel processes have finished, the activity is considered done, and it proceeds to the maintenance phase.

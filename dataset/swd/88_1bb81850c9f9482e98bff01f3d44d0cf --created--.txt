The process begins with OTG's lead mechanic doing a diagnostic inspection of the car and then creating a repair plan. After creating the repair plan, the OTG's main mechanic, auto body mechanic, and interior mechanic start their respective jobs at the same time. 
1. The main mechanic repairs the engine and then creates the proper report; if the engine report is not okay, then continue to repair the engine until the engine report is okay. 
2. The auto body mechanic needs to look at the car for scratches and dents. If there are, repair the dents while creating a list of dents. If there are no scratches or dents, then paint the car directly, in addition to painting the car after the repair. Then the auto body mechanic needs to paint the car and check the tires for damage. If they are damaged, the tires need to be repaired first, and then a report of the activities he has done needs to be written. If the tires are not damaged, then skip repairing the tires and just write a report on the activity. 
3. The interior mechanic checks if the leather is not inside and the seats are worn out, then fixes them. After that, check the dashboard for damage and replace it if it is damaged. Then check the panel for damage, and if damaged, repair it. Finally, a report on the repairs is also required. 
When all the reports from all three mechanics are completed, the main mechanic collects all the data to do the final check. If the engine is working properly, the process ends. Otherwise, the engine needs to be completed before ending.

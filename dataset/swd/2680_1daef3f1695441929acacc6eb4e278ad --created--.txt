The process of making and selling Hershey's chocolate begins when cocoa beans are received. The first step is for the Quality Control Officer (QCO) to inspect the cocoa beans for any defects. Typically, only 10% of the beans are defective. The QCO rejects the defective beans and manually fills out the Cocoa Beans Defect Form. They then pass the form to the dispatch personnel (DP). The DP takes the Cocoa Bean Defect Form from the QCO and brings it to the Logistics Manager (LM). The LM, upon receiving the form, sends an email to the supplier requesting a new batch of cocoa beans.
For the cocoa beans that are not defective, the Assembly Line Worker (ALW) ensures that the approved beans are sorted into batches using a machine (90% of the beans). The Quality Control Officer (QCO) takes samples (5%) from each batch of cocoa beans and processes them into chocolate liquor. Extensive sampling is conducted on each batch of chocolate to test for flavor and aroma. If the quality of a batch is not approved by the QCO (around 20% of the batches), the QCO rejects the substandard batch of cocoa beans and fills in the Cocoa Beans Defect Form manually. The Dispatch Personnel (DP) receives the defected cocoa beans and the Cocoa Beans Defect Form from the QCO, and they dispose of the defected beans. The DP then brings the Cocoa Bean Defect Form to the Logistics Manager (LM). Additionally, the LM requests a new batch of cocoa beans from the supplier via email.
For the cocoa beans that are approved (80%), the Quality Control Officer gives their approval and removes any unclean substances from the beans. The machine operator (MO) takes over and roasts the cocoa beans using a roaster machine. Then, the MO separates the shells from the cocoa beans using a winnowing machine. The cocoa nibs are then passed to the Cocoa Crusher (CC), who properly crushes them using a crushing machine. In case the cocoa nibs are not crushed properly (15% of the time), the CC performs manual grinding to ensure proper crushing. After this step, the MO takes over again and rotates the chocolate liquor in a conch machine. The MO then tempers and cools the chocolate liquor until it is ready to be molded. Regarding the molded chocolate liquor, there are two variations: 40% is flavored, and 60% is original. The machine operator (MO) adds either caramel or peanut butter to the chocolate to create the flavored batches (40%). Once the chocolate is ready, the dispatch personnel (DP) deliver it from the MO to the logistics manager (LM) at the office. The LM stores the batches of chocolate in the warehouse and manually prepares a chocolate inventory list using the ERP system. The Chief Sales Officer (CSO) obtains the chocolate inventory list from the LM and updates it in the ERP system. Additionally, the CSO receives a purchase order (PO) from the distributor via email and inputs the relevant details into the ERP system. The Chief Sales Officer (CSO) refers to the purchase order (PO) and determines the amount of chocolate shortage that needs to be produced. The CSO updates the shortage amount in the ERP system. Next, the Logistics Manager (LM) checks the chocolate shortage information through the ERP system and prepares a purchase invoice for the required amount of cocoa beans. This information is then entered into the supply chain management (SCM) system. The LM also checks the updated Purchase Order (PO) through the ERP system and prepares a sales invoice for the distributor.
When the chocolate is delivered, the process comes to an end.

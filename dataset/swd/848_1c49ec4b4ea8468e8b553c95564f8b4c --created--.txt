If the medicine is not OTC, the pharmacist checks the prescription. If the prescription is legal, the pharmacist then determines whether the medicine is being collected for someone else.  If the prescription is not legal, the pharmacist first contacts the doctor. The doctor then verifies the prescription. If the prescription cannot be verified, the pharmacist rejects the collection, and the customer leaves.  If the prescription is verified, the pharmacist then determines whether the medicine is being collected for someone else.

If the medicine is not being collected for someone else, the pharmacist asks for Medicare information.  However, if it is being collected for someone else, the pharmacist checks if it falls under the S8 category.  If it is not an S8 medicine, the pharmacist asks for Medicare information. If it is an S8 medicine, the doctor verifies both the patient and the person collecting the medicine. If the verification fails, the pharmacist rejects the collection, and the customer leaves. If the verification is successful, the pharmacist asks for Medicare information.

After the pharmacist asks for Medicare information, the IT system collects and retrieves the information. Then, the pharmacist prints instructions and labels. After that, the pharmacist carefully affixes the labels and re-checks everything. Finally, the pharmacist provides the medicine along with counseling, and the customer can leave.

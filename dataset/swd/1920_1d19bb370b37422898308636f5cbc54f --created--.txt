To complete a program of study with an internship, the student must follow several steps. Firstly, they need to enroll in the study program. In order to fulfill the requirements, they must meet four conditions: completion of an internship, obtaining 120 credits, completing all mandatory courses, and having a thesis topic. To fulfill the condition of completing an internship, the student should submit an application for an internship to the Office for Studies for evaluation. They should continue this process until the Office for Studies grants permission. Once permission is granted, they can proceed to complete the internship. Regarding the requirement of having a thesis topic, the student should choose an advisor and a topic for their thesis. Once they receive an agreement message from the thesis advisor, they can proceed with the subsequent work.
The next step involves two tasks: the state final exam and the defense of the thesis. The student needs to submit an application for the state final examination and another application for the defense of the thesis to the Office for Studies. The Office for Studies will check if all the requirements are fulfilled. If any requirements are not met, the student needs to reapply accordingly. Once the applications have been approved, the student should proceed to take the state final exam and complete their thesis. Afterward, they need to defend their thesis. In case they fail the exam or do not successfully defend their thesis, they must submit new applications for the state final examination or for the defense of the thesis, respectively. When both the state final exam and the defense of the thesis are passed, the student can participate in the graduation ceremony.

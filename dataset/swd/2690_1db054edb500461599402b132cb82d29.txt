The process of cooking in the kitchen is as follows. When Nonnina receives an order, the process of preparing the meal begins. The process involves cooking noodles and chopping onions by the nephews, chopping other ingredients by the nieces, cooking pasta sauce by the Pasta & Risotto Expert and making a salad by the Salad & Antipasti Expert.
Nonnina's nephews start by cooking the noodles as part of the meal preparation. Meanwhile, Nonnina's nieces chop the required ingredients. Additionally, the Salad & Antipasti Expert takes charge of making the salad.
During the free time of cooking noodles, the nephews also chop onions, and the nieces continue to chop the necessary ingredients. The Pasta & Risotto Expert joins onions and ingredients to cook the pasta sauce.
Once the pasta sauce is ready, it is combined with the cooked noodles and salad. Finally, Nonnina gathered together to complete this meal.
Finally, when the meal is ready with all the components combined, the process concludes.

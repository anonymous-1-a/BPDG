The travel request process for an employee at a university is as follows:
First, the employee completes the request for travel form in MS Word. Then, the employee uploads the form to the approval management system. Next, the supervisor checks the request for travel form and subsequently verifies the availability of funds in the nominated account. Is an amendment required for the travel form? If the answer is yes, the supervisor will comment on the issues found on the form. After providing the comments, if the employee makes the necessary changes, they will complete the request for travel form in MS Word again. However, if the employee does not make any changes, the request will be cancelled, and the process will terminate. If no amendment is required, the next question is whether the request is approved. If the answer is no, the request will be rejected. If the answer is yes, the supervisor will approve the travel form using digital signatures. The employee will then download the approved Request for Travel Form, and the request will be marked as approved.

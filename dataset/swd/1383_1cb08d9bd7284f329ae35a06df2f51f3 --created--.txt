The process begins with the following steps:
1. The IAAP (International Association of Administrative Professionals) creates a draft of the resolution proposal.
2. The IAAP simultaneously requests a report from the Consultative Board (CB) and another report from the Legal Department (LD). Afterwards, the IAAP receives the reports from both the CB and LD. Once the reports are received, they are analyzed.
3. Is an external resolution required? If the answer is no, the IAAP reviews the resolution proposal. If the answer is yes, the IAAP requests an external resolution from the External Committee. Then, the IAAP receives the external resolution. In both cases, the IAAP signs the resolution, stores it, and notifies the relevant parties about the resolution.
After these steps, the process comes to an end.

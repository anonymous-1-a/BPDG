When there is a need for a doctor's evaluation in the hospital process, the following steps are followed. First, the referee interviews the patients. Simultaneously, the managing director asks an external expert to review the case. The referee receives the expertise from the external expert. The managing director then checks if the expertise was received in a timely manner. If not, the managing director asks another expert to review the case. This loop continues until the expertise is received on time. Once the expertise is received, the managing director forwards it to the referee. The referee then files the results of the evaluation. Additionally, the managing director checks and files the necessary documentation to pay the expert for their services. Finally, the process concludes.

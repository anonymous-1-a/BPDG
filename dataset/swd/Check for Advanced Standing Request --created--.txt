There is a check for advanced standing requests at the University of 's-Hertogenbosch. The professional staff of the university checks advanced standing requests. If no request is attached to enrollment, the advance standing is completed. Otherwise, the professional staff will identify the correlating unit coordinator and then send an advance standing request document to the related coordinator. The academic staff assesses student requests after receiving an advance standing request from the professional staff.
If there is enough information provided, the academic staff determines the outcome based on the student's information. If the request is approved, update the student progress information system. However, if the academic staff considers that the student does not meet the requirements, the advanced standing request is denied.
If there is more information required, they should ask the student for it. The student must respond within 10 days. When there is no reply after more than ten days, the advance standing request will be automatically denied. If you respond on time, academic staff will also decide whether to agree.
